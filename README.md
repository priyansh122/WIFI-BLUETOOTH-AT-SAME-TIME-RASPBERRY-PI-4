SOLUTION FOR THE CONNECTION BREAKING OF BLUETOOTH WHEN YOU TRY TO USE BOTH BLUETOOTH HEADSETS AND WIFI AT SAME TIME IN RASPBERRY PI.
So lets get started


A] SOME SUGGESTIONS
1. BACKUP YOUR FILES IF THEY ARE IMPORTANT
2. NO NEED TO INSTALL BLUETOOTH MANAGER SU8CH AS BLUEMAN ETC.
3. KEEP OR COPY THE NOOBS FILE TILL YOUR PROBLEM IS SOLVED


B] THE PROCESS
1. it is a software problem. i have faced the same problem when i was using my pi with bluetooth headsets and wifi together.
2. in order to solve this problem you have to reinstall the os. i would recommand you to use NOOBS(i have installed version 3.3.1 of NOOBS). you can install NOOBS in your SD card using a computer or a smartphone.
4. if you are using smartphone to install NOOBS in your SD card then download ZArchiever and extract the NOOBS file in your SD card. (dont forget to format the SD card you can also do this in your smartphone)
5. Then install the raspbian os
6. now as you are in the desktop environment connect your wifi and bluetooth headsets to the raspberry pi
7. now open the browser and use youtube and audio output should be there with wifi still working.(you can update your raspberry pi but dont upgrade it as it is a software problem)
8. if it does not work then install firefox in the OS by using the command line (sudo apt-get install firefox-esr) in the terminal.( it doesn't work fopr me as well so i am using firefox)
9. open youitube in the firefox and audio output would be there with wifi still working.
